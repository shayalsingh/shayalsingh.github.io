    <h1>The Rainbow</h1>
     <p>Boats sail on the rivers,
And ships sail on the seas;<p>
But clouds that sail across the sky<p>
Are prettier than these.<p>
There are bridges on the rivers,<p>
As pretty as you please;<p>
But the bow that bridges heaven,<p>
And overtops the trees,<p>
And builds a road from earth to sky,<p>
Is prettier far than these.<p>
